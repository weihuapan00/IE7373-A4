COVID-19 Vaccine:
What You Need to Know
1. Why get vaccinated?
COVID‑19 vaccine can prevent COVID‑19 disease. 
Vaccination can help reduce the severity of COVID‑19 
disease if you get sick.
COVID‑19 is caused by a coronavirus called 
SARS‑CoV‑2 that spreads easily from person to 
person. COVID‑19 can cause mild to moderate illness 
lasting only a few days, or severe illness requiring 
hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help 
with breathing. COVID‑19 can result in death.
If an infected person has symptoms, they may appear 
2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can 
have mild to severe symptoms.
  Possible symptoms include fever or chills, cough, 
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue 
(tiredness), muscle or body aches, headache, new loss 
of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny 
nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea.
  More serious symptoms can include trouble 
breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, 
new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or 
pale, gray, or blue‑colored skin, lips, or nail beds, 
depending on skin tone.
Older adults and people with certain underlying 
medical conditions (like heart or lung disease or 
diabetes) are more likely to get very sick from 
COVID‑19.
2. COVID‑19 vaccine
Updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID‑19 vaccine is 
recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older.
COVID‑19 vaccines for infants and children 6 months 
through 11 years of age are available under Emergency 
Use Authorization from the U. S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). Please refer to the Fact Sheets 
for Recipients and Caregivers for more information.
For people 12 years of age and older, updated 
COVID‑19 vaccines, manufactured by ModernaTX, 
Inc. or Pfizer, Inc., are approved by FDA.
  Everyone 12 years and older should get 1 dose of 
an FDA‑approved, updated 2023–2024 COVID‑19 
vaccine. If you have received a COVID‑19 vaccine 
recently, you should wait at least 8 weeks after your 
most recent dose to get the updated 2023–2024 
COVID‑19 vaccine.
  Certain people who have medical conditions or are 
taking medications that affect the immune system 
may get additional doses of COVID‑19 vaccine. Your 
health care provider can advise you.
Some people 12 years of age and older might get 
a different COVID‑19 vaccine called Novavax 
COVID‑19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted (2023–2024 Formula) 
instead. This vaccine is available under Emergency Use 
Authorization from FDA. Please refer to the Fact Sheet 
for Recipients and Caregivers for more information.
3.  Talk with your health  
care provider
Tell your vaccination provider if the person getting  
the vaccine:
  Has had an allergic reaction after a previous 
dose of COVID‑19 vaccine or an ingredient in 
the COVID‑19 vaccine, or has any severe, life‑
threatening allergies
  Has had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart 
muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining 
outside of the heart)
  Has had multisystem inflammatory syndrome 
(called MIS‑C in children and MIS‑A in adults)
  Has a weakened immune system
In some cases, your health care provider may decide to 
postpone COVID‑19 vaccination until a future visit.

Vaccine Information Statement
COVID-19 Vaccine
People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be 
vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely 
ill should usually wait until they recover. People 
with current COVID‑19 infection should wait to get 
vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness 
and discontinued isolation.
Pregnant people with COVID‑19 are at increased 
risk for severe illness. COVID‑19 vaccination 
is recommended for people who are pregnant, 
breastfeeding, or trying to get pregnant now, or who 
might become pregnant in the future.
COVID‑19 vaccine may be given at the same time as 
other vaccines.
4. Risks of a vaccine reaction
  Pain, swelling, or redness where the shot is 
given, fever, tiredness (fatigue), headache, chills, 
muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and 
swollen lymph nodes can happen after COVID‑19 
vaccination.
  Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) 
or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside 
the heart) have been seen rarely after COVID‑19 
vaccination. This risk has been observed most 
commonly in males 12 through 39 years of age.  
The chance of this occurring is low.
People sometimes faint after medical procedures, 
including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel 
dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.
As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance 
of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other 
serious injury, or death.
5.  What if there is a  
serious problem?
An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated 
person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe 
allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, 
difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or 
weakness), call 9‑1‑1 and get the person to the nearest 
hospital.
Seek medical attention right away if the vaccinated 
person experiences chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or feelings of having a fast‑beating, fluttering, or 
pounding heart after COVID‑19 vaccination. These 
could be symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis.
For other signs that concern you, call your health  
care provider.
Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your 
health care provider will usually file this report, or  
you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website at 
www.vaers.hhs.gov or call 1‑800‑822‑7967. VAERS is 
only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members 
do not give medical advice.
6.  Countermeasures Injury 
Compensation Program
The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program 
(CICP) is a federal program that may help pay for 
costs of medical care and other specific expenses of 
certain people who have been seriously injured by 
certain medicines or vaccines, including this vaccine. 
Generally, a claim must be submitted to the CICP 
within one (1) year from the date of receiving the 
vaccine. To learn more about this program, visit 
the program’s website at www.hrsa.gov/cicp, or call 
1‑855‑266‑2427.
